# 🔥 Calories Burnt Prediction using Linear Regression (from Scratch)

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project where I implemented **linear regression from scratch using NumPy** to predict how many **calories a person burns** during exercise — based only on the **duration** of the workout.

I built this project after completing **Module 1 of the Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (Coursera)** to better understand the math and mechanics of **gradient descent**.

## 📈 What the Project Does

- Predicts `Calories Burnt` based on `Duration (minutes)` of physical activity.
- Uses only **one input feature** to keep the implementation simple and intuitive.
- Implements the entire training loop from scratch:
  - Cost function (Mean Squared Error)
  - Gradient computation
  - Parameter updates using gradient descent
- Plots:
  - Cost vs Iterations
  - Predicted vs Actual Calories

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy (math & arrays)
- Matplotlib (plots)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How **gradient descent** works step by step
- The importance of choosing a good **learning rate**
- How to go from math formulas to actual working code
- That even simple models can teach a lot when you implement them yourself

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset Source: [Calories Burnt Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos)
- Files used:
  - `exercise.csv`
  - `calories.csv`
- These two were merged using `User_ID` to create a unified dataset.
## 🤝 Acknowledgements

- Inspired by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/~andrewng)'s **Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera**
- Gradient Descent logic based on his lab structure and adapted to a real-world dataset

## 🧠 Future Improvements (Optional Ideas)

- Extend to multivariate regression (include Age, Weight, Heart Rate, etc.)
- Compare this implementation with `scikit-learn`’s built-in linear regression
- Try polynomial regression or regularization
- Deploy as a simple Streamlit/Flask web app
